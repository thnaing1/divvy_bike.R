My data analysis project for Divvy Bike Sharing Data

Title: Bikesharing Analysis of the behavioral differences between Subscribers and Non-subscribers 

Data Collection method: Third Party Data
Data Sources: https://divvybikes.com/ through Google Data Analytics course

Coding Language: R 

Context:
This is a project that I completed for the Google Data Analytics course. This dataset I obtained though the course and came from the Divvybikes company. In this project I want to determine empirically the differences in the behaviors between those who has a membership and those who do not. By analyzing consumer behavior and bike activity, I hope to determine if there exists an opportunity to convince casual riders to sign on to become members. In addition, I want to empirically determine the best possible strategies that the company in question can utilize to convince casual riders to purchase memberships. 

Content:
- I have included a report that I created using R markdown of the R project that I completed. This report explains line by line my thought processes, implimentations, and analysis following a standard data analysis process.
- I have also included the raw R code

Purpose:
This demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, data analysis and R.
